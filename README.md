# A Knight's Journey

_A mini-game with 3 levels where you embark on an epic quest as a brave knight!_

## Overview

"A Knight's Journey" was first developed using Scratch as part of a collaborative project with a group of enthusiastic developers. Due to the game's popularity and the desire to make it accessible on more platforms, we ported it to both HTML for web browsers and a Windows executable (32-bit) for desktop users.

In this game, you'll guide your knight through a series of challenges spread across 3 different levels. Whether you're facing enemies, avoiding traps, or collecting treasures, each level offers a unique experience that will test your skills and bravery.
